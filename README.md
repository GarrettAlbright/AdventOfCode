[Garrett Albright][ga]'s solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles at 
http://adventofcode.com

Implemented in Swift in pure .swift files (rather than Xcode projects). Run them
from the CLI using `swift main.swift`

(Okay, I gave up and implemented Day 04 as an Xcode project because I needed a
crypto library, and I couldn't figure out how to do that from just the CLI. It
may not actually be possible yetâ€¦?)

Each day has two puzzles but since they're related, I'm (so far, at least)
solving both puzzles in one Swift file per day.

If you're doing these puzzles, note that your input will differ, so you'll want
to change the input.txt files to whatever your input is.

It should be noted that I'm explicitly not writing clean, efficient,
well-documented code here; my goal is to merely solve the puzzles and get a bit
more practice with Swift in the meantime. In other words, please don't judge me
too harshly by the code quality here - I can do better if I try. :P
