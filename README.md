[Garrett Albright][ga]'s solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles at 
http://adventofcode.com

Implemented in Swift in pure .swift files (rather than Xcode projects). Run them
from the CLI using `swift main.swift`

Each day has two puzzles but since they're related, I'm (so far, at least)
solving both puzzles in one Swift file per day.

If you're doing these puzzles, note that your input will differ, so you'll want
to change the input.txt files to whatever your input is.
